     * Draws the object that was given to this view model, as if it kept moving at the same velocity it had at the last
     * game tick. If every game tick an object's location changes by adding its velocity's x and y components to it,
     * then to draw the object at a time between ticks, we need to add only a fraction of the object's velocity that is
     * proportional to fraction of a game tick duration that has elapsed so far.
     * <p>
     * For example, let's assume that the game ticks every 100ms (not really, but it's easy to think about).
     * - Then, let's say that the FPS is set so that the display updates every 20ms.
     * - This means that when the game starts at 0ms, it ticks (updating physics for all the objects), and updates the
     * display. The next time the game will refresh, 20ms will have passed, and according to the game model (which has
     * not ticked yet since the game started) all objects are in their same place.
     * - However, we want to make it appear like the objects are moving. Since the game ticks every 100ms, 20ms is just
     * 20% of that. To give the appearance that an object is moving at the same speed as it would be according to game
     * physics, we can draw the object at a new position every 20ms, adding 20% of its velocity to its location, instead
     * of the 100% that would be added in a normal game tick.
     * - Therefore, every time the display refreshes, the object appears in a different position.
     * <p>
     * Please note: We DO NOT update the actual game objects' locations. This is purely a visual trick, and to update
     * the objects' locations would give an unfair advantage to faster PC's, and also cause rounding errors to
     * accumulate faster.

     * @param graphics2D        The graphics object used to draw the object.
     * @param timeSinceLastTick The number of milliseconds since the last game tick.
